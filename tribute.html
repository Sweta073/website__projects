        <h3>Childhood and family</h3>
    <p>
        Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.
        [3] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada,[4][5][6]
         but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot,
          sailor, consultant, and property developer.[7] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, 
          Tosca (born 1974).[6][8] His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,[9][10] and Musk has 
          British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[11][12] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father 
          in Pretoria and elsewhere,[11] a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[13] Musk has become 
          estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, 
          he has done."[13] He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side.[9][14]

          Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20.[15][16] He learned 
          computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and
           Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[17][18] An awkward and introverted child,[19] Musk was bullied throughout his
            childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs.[13][20] He attended Waterkloof House 
            Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.
